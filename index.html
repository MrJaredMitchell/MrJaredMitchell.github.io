<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a third year Computer Science student at Farmingdale State College.
    I am currently working on two group projects: an automated inventory system, and a Dungeons n' Dragons inspired game.  
    When these are completed, I intend to work on updating an old project to upload here: a Markov text generator</p>
